[Silk Rest API](https://silkapp.github.io/rest/) using [Snap](http://snapframework.com/)
===================================

This is just a simple example app of how to use the Snap framework to provide the
basis for serving routes provided by a Silk REST API.

It's very barebones at the moment, nothing fancy going on. But it supports the Snap
development mode and recompiling when source files are changed.

Some mangling of the dependencies was required to make this build properly, and thus
far nothing appears to have suffered. More experimentation will reveal if this has
caused any issues.
